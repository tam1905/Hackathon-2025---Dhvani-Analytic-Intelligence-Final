# Hackathon-2025: Defect Detection, Dynamical System Plotting, and Vehicle Detection

This repository contains solutions for **Hackathon-2025**, focusing on:  

1. **Defect Detection**: Detecting flashes and cut marks in images using image processing and deep learning.  
2. **Dynamical System Simulation**: Plotting 3D paths of a system over time using given differential equations.  
3. **Vehicle Detection and Classification**: Detecting and classifying vehicles (cars, buses, motorbikes) using annotated image datasets.  
4. **Visualization and Evaluation**: Analysis of object distributions, bounding box sizes, and model performance metrics.

All code is modular, well-commented, and follows **PEP8** guidelines.

## Folder Structure

- **Task One – Defect Detection**: Detect and classify flashes and cut marks in circular objects using Canny edge detector and image processing.  
- **Task Two – Dynamical System Simulation**: Simulate and plot the Lorenz system (3D dynamical path) using numerical methods (RK4).  
- **Task Three – Vehicle Detection and Classification**: Train an object detector to identify and classify vehicles (cars, buses, motorbikes) from annotated datasets.
